Counting a Score Point


This is a project to calculate the total score points in the game.

The score points involve 2 players. We can set the total score points for the winner to be 5, 10, or 15. 
If one of the players reaches the specified score point, the game will be considered finished. 
If none have achieved it at all, the game will continue until one player reaches the specified score.
